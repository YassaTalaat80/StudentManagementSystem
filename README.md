# Student Management System


## Project Overview

The **Student Management System** is a C++ console application that simulates the registration process for students in various courses within a university.  
The system supports different types of courses (Normal and Summer courses) and different types of students (General Program Students and Special Program Students).  
Each student can register for up to six courses, and the system ensures that the registration process adheres to certain constraints, such as student level and course availability.
